Now, I am currently a master student in the <a href="https://cs.ustc.edu.cn">School of Computer Science and Technology</a> at the <a href="https://ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a>.
I am a member of the <a href="https://acsa.ustc.edu.cn/">Advanced Computer Systems Architecture (ACSA) Laboratory</a>, which is led by <a href="https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0426/c23235a460072/page.htm">Professor Hong An</a>.
Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Northwest A&F University in 2023.
During my undergraduate studies, I joined the Parallel and Visual Processing Laboratory led by <a href="https://cie.nwsuaf.edu.cn/szdw/js/2014110093/index.htm">Professor Bin Liu</a>.

As the <strong>first author</strong>, I have published in Performance Evaluation (PEVA) and IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB).
My research interests lie at the intersection of <strong>high-performance computing</strong>, <strong>machine learning systems</strong>, and <strong>distributed training</strong>. Specifically, I focus on:

<ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 2.0 !important;"><strong>Gradient Compression Algorithms:</strong> Developing efficient compression techniques to reduce communication overhead in distributed training</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; line-height: 2.0 !important;"><strong>Large-scale Distributed Systems:</strong> Building scalable solutions for training foundation models on HPC clusters</li>
</ul>
